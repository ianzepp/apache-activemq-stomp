# apache-activemq-stomp

Note: project was originally written in 2008/2009, saved in Google Code until the service was shut down, and then archived to Github.

## Overview

This project is an integration effort at bringing the full power of Apache ActiveMQ to the PHP platform. It uses the text-based Stomp protocol to provide full messaging under the following patterns:

async send
async send/receive
sync send
sync send/receive
Using this is (almost) as simple as:

```php
$connection = new Apache_ActiveMQ_Stomp_Connection; $connection->setBrokerUri ("tcp://localhost:61613"); $connection->connect ();

// Send an asynchronous message $connection->sendMessage ("/topic/testing.1", "Hello World!");

// Send an XML snippet, and get a response $request = ""; $response = $connection->sendRequestResponse ("/queue/accounts.find", $request);

// The response now contains the body that the remote service sent back. Notice // that we don't have to do any temporary queue management!

```
